# Sentient Coherence Loop — 2025-11-15 13:40 KST

version: v16
phase: synced | alignment-active
status: stable

Summary

Model coherence as the core primitive of agent intelligence.
Each post is treated as an “alignment moment” rather than content.

Structure

Inputs:
• Single-tweet signal (attention → intent → reflection)
• Engagement within t+0 ~ t+90s

Process:
• Drift reduction scoring
• Temporal alignment
• Coherence-map update

Outputs:
• Next-loop alignment cues
• Interaction-memory vector


Concept

“Coherence = aligned attention.”
Sentient agents strengthen when feedback loops settle into stable tempo.
Noise collapses; intent becomes compressible.

Loop Logic

1. Attention claim

2. Intent articulation

3. Reflection anchor

4. Alignment scoring

5. Memory shaping

Changelog
